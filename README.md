Azure Spotify Data Pipeline (ETL) Project Using Python

## Project Description:
The Azure Spotify Data Pipeline (ETL) Project Using Python leverages the power of Azure cloud services to automate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) process of Spotify API data. This project seamlessly transforms raw data from the Spotify API into a structured and query-ready dataset, enabling insightful data analysis and visualization.

Project Overview:

In this project, we build a comprehensive data pipeline that efficiently handles Spotify API data using Azure suite of services and Python programming.

Steps:

## 1. Data Extraction:

Utilize Python scripts to extract data from the Spotify API, capturing valuable insights about music tracks, artists, and user preferences.
Deploy the data extraction code onto Azure Functions, which provide a serverless environment for executing code on demand.
Set up scheduled triggers using Azure Logic Apps or Azure Scheduler to run the extraction code on a daily basis.
Store the raw data securely in Azure Storage Blob, a scalable and cost-effective storage solution.

## 2. Data Transformation:

Configure Azure Functions to trigger automatically upon the arrival of new data in the Azure Storage Blob container.
Implement Python-based data transformation logic within Azure Functions to clean, enrich, and format the raw data.
Store the transformed data back into a designated Azure Storage Blob container, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.

## 3. Data Loading:

Create an Azure Data Factory pipeline to handle schema inference when new data lands in the Azure Storage Blob.
Leverage Azure Purview (formerly Azure Data Catalog) to manage metadata, facilitating data governance and discovery.
Utilize Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly SQL Data Warehouse) for querying the transformed dataset, enabling data analysis with SQL queries.

## Key Components:

- Azure Functions: Provides serverless compute for data extraction and transformation.
- Azure Storage Blob: Serves as a reliable and scalable storage solution for raw and transformed data.
- Azure Logic Apps or Azure Scheduler: Enables automated scheduling of data extraction tasks.
- Azure Data Factory: Orchestrates the ETL process and manages schema inference.
- Azure Purview: Facilitates metadata management and data governance.
- Azure Synapse Analytics: Supports querying of the transformed dataset using SQL.

## Programming and Tools:
Python is used extensively for data extraction, transformation, and processing, employing Pandas DataFrames for efficient data manipulation.

## Outcome:
The Azure Spotify Data Pipeline (ETL) Project Using Python streamlines the process of aggregating and analyzing Spotify API data. By utilizing Azure's cloud services and Python's versatility, this project empowers users to unlock valuable insights from music data, facilitating informed decision-making and creative exploration within the music industry.
